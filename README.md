# Particle Swarm Optimization Example
We solve the problems we encounter from time to time by being inspired by nature. This method is also actively used in computer technologies. There are heuristic optimization algorithms to solve optimization problems, but as I mentioned at the beginning of my article, many optimization algorithms have been developed inspired by natural processes. **Particle Swarm Optimization** algorithm is one of them.

While developing Particle Swarm Optimization, it was inspired by the observation that the movements of some animals traveling in herd for their basic needs such as finding food affect other members of the herd and that the herd achieves its goal more easily.
Dr. Kennedy and Dr. It is an optimization algorithm developed by Eberhart in 1995.

Simply, PSO aims to reach the optimum solution by hiding the best solutions of the herd individuals.
